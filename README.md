To successfully run the code, you should follow the steps below

- Make sure you have installed the required libs

- Generate dataset with 'dataset_generator.py', the data will be available in the corresponding folders (check before running).

- Training DL models (PSCNet and ECNet) in 'training_DL.py'and testing them with 'testing.py' (please read the functions created in 'additional_functions.py')

- In addition, the codes in 'complexity' folder are ready to run.
